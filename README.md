# 🩺 Ultrasound Scan Quality Check

A machine learning system that evaluates ultrasound image quality at capture time.  
The model flags scans as **clear**, **unclear**, or **uncertain** to guide whether a retake is needed before interpretation.

This system focuses on **scan quality**, not diagnosis.

## 🖼 Demo Overview

Upload an ultrasound image to receive:
- A scan quality assessment  
- A confidence level  
- A recommended next action  

Example outputs:
- “Clear scan. Proceed with interpretation.”  
- “Unclear scan. Retake and adjust probe angle or brightness.”

## ⚡ Features  
- Web-based ultrasound image upload  
- Automatic grayscale preprocessing and normalization  
- Convolutional Neural Network for scan quality assessment  
- Conservative decision thresholds to reduce overconfident predictions  
- Action-oriented outputs designed for real-time feedback  
- Public demo deployed on Hugging Face Spaces  

## 🧠 Model Details  
- TensorFlow / Keras Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Input: grayscale ultrasound images (128 × 128)  
- Output: probability that a scan is unclear  
- Threshold-based mapping to:
  - Clear  
  - Uncertain  
  - Unclear  
- Designed to provide immediate guidance at the point of image capture
